The mplus.lang file contains a very simple GtkSourceView language definition. It is intended to allow for syntax highlighting when using gedit to write Mplus input files and read Mplus output files. To add Mplus highlighting to gedit simply copy mplus.lang to ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs. If you want to connect the Mplus mime type to the typical Mplus files (.inp and .out) copy mplus.xml to ~/.local/share/mime/packages.
